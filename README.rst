Django Depiction
================

What's this for
---------------

We were looking for profiling tools as we worked on improving the performance of
one of our Django applications.  We didn't find anything that tripped our
triggers so this was created.

It's some tooling, right now Middleware and a decorator, that allows you to
quickly see some profile data and optionally export a ``.kgrind`` file suitable
for viewing in KDE's KCacheGrind.

Installation
------------

You need Django for this to work, if you need help with that `head here
<http://djangoproject.com>`_

Using Pip::

    pip install django-depiction

Or::

    pip install -e git+http://github.com/robmadole/django-depiction.git#egg=djangodepiction


Settings
--------

Edit your Django settings, adding this to the ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES``. ::

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
        ...
        'depiction.middleware.ProfilerMiddleware',
    )

Add the following setting ::

    PROFILING = True

And make sure that your internal IP address is present ::

    INTERNAL_IPS = ('127.0.0.1',)

Middleware usage
----------------

You can trigger output by adding ``prof`` to the query string.  For example, say
this was a URL in your application ::

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/lumberjacks/list

To get some profile data on this page ::

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/lumberjacks/list?prof

If you already have a query string, add to it like this ::

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/lumberjacks/list?playsDressup=True&prof

To filter by filename ::

    http://127.0.0.1:8000/lumberjacks/list?playsDressup=True&prof=django/template

Creating ``kgrind`` files
-------------------------

There is a project called KCacheGrind that provides a GUI for analyzing profile
data.  You are on your own to get KCacheGrind installed, but once you do you
will need a ``.kgrind`` file to look at.

You can do this with a decorator.  Here is a Django View example. ::

    from django.template.loader import render_to_response
    from depiction.decorator import kgrind

    from lumberjacks.models import *


    @kgrind('listing_lumberjacks.kgrind')
    def list_lumberjacks(request):
        return render_to_response('lumberjacks/list.html', {
            men': Lumberjacks.objects.all()})
        
This will create a ``listing_lumberjacks.kgrind`` file in the current working
directory.  You can then load this into KCacheGrind.
    
Credits
-------

This was mostly inspired by David Cramer's Middleware.  He get's most of the
credit for the idea and seed of the code we wrote.
