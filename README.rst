Django Depiction
================

What's this for
---------------

We were looking for profiling tools as we worked on improving the performance of
one of our Django applications.  We didn't find anything that tripped our
triggers so this was created.

It's some tooling, right now Middleware and a decorator, that allows you to
quickly see some profile data and optionally export a ``.kgrind`` file suitable
for viewing in KDE's KCacheGrind.

Credits

This was mostly inspired by David Cramer's Middleware.  He get's most of the
credit for the idea and seed of the code we wrote.
